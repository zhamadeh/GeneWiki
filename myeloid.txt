Initial risk assignment may change during the treatment course based on the results from analyses of measurable residual disease. Over 100 KMT2A fusion partners have been described where the seven most frequent translocation partners account for more than 90% of all recombinations of the KMT2A, 37 occur recurrently and 63 were identified so far only once (PMID: 37019990). AFF1, AFDN, MLLT10, TET1, ELL and MLLT1 fusion partners are associated with adverse risk categorization whereas MLLT3 is associacted with intermediate risk (ELN, PMID: 35797463). The presence of t(9;11)(p21.3;q23.3) MLLT3::KMT2A takes precedence over rare, concurrent adverse risk gene mutations. t(v;11q23.3)/KMT2A-rearrangement is associated with adverse risk category excluding KMT2A partial tandem duplication (PTD)(ELN, PMID: 35797463).
