In the context of AML, TET2 mutations have been identified in approximately 10-20% of AML cases. In AML, a recent meta-analysis revealed TET2 mutations to be associated with inferior outcomes (Wang (2019) PMID:31023266). While TET2 mutations have been identified in approximately 20-25% of MDS cases, they have not been found to be a significant prognostic marker. Response to hypomethylating agents does however appear to be better in patients harbouring TET2 mutations (NCCN Guidelines - MDS 2023).

In the context of AML, CSF3R mutations are identified in approximately 2-4% of AML cases and 1-2% of MDS cases. Activating mutations of the CSF3R protein lead to constitutive JAK-STAT pathway signalling (Zhang (2017) PMID:28439110). The predictive and prognostic significance of CSF3R mutations in AML remain uncertain. Activating changes in CSF3R are a diagnostic feature of chronic neutrophilic leukemia (CNL) (WHO PMID: 31769070) but may also be identified in a subset of atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (aCML) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) (NCCN Guidelines - MDS 2021; Pardanani (2013) PMID:23604229, Gotlib (2013) PMID:23896413; Maxson (2013) PMID:23656643). Activating CSF3R changes are associated with more aggressive disease in CNL and sensitivity to ruxolitinib (Dao (2020) PMID:31880950, Szuber (2020) PMID:31769070). Emerging data suggests that aCML patients with CSF3R or JAK2 mutations may respond to ruxolitinib therapy in combination with HMAs (hypomethylating agent) (NCCN Guidelines - MDS 2021).

Preclinical studies have shown leukemic cells expressing mutant CBL and wild-type FLT3 are sensitive to FLT3 inhibition (Weisberg (2019) PMID: 31309543; Weisberg (2020) PMID: 31943762).

In the context of AML, CALR mutations are identified in 20-25% of MF and ET cases though rarely identified in de novo AML cases. PMF patients with a CALR mutation have improved survival compared to either JAK2-mutant or triple-negative patients (NCCN Guidelines - MPN 2023) and ET patients with a CALR mutation have a lower-risk of thrombosis compared to JAK2-mutated ET (NCCN Guidelines - MPN 2023).
