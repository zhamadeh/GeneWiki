In the context of AML, PTPN11 mutations are identified in ~5% of AML cases (Hou (2008) PMID: 1797295). In AML, PTPN11 mutations have been associated with a poor prognosis (Alfayez (2020) PMID: 32561839). Although PTPN11 mutations are rare in adult MDS, they are identified in ~10% of pediatric MDS and in ~34% of non-syndromic JMML (Tartaglia (2003) PMID: 12717436). PTPN11 mutation have been correlated with poorer overall survival, however, PTPN11 status should not be used to determine the effectiveness of hypomethylating agents (NCCN Guidelines - MDS 2022). Although PTPN11 mutations are rare in MPN, they are identified in ~34% of non-syndromic JMML (Tartaglia (2003) PMID: 12717436). The predictive and prognostic significance of PTPN11 mutations in MPN remain uncertain.
