In the context of AML, CUX1MT were present in 4% of chronic myeloid neoplasms (PMID: 31320321)The CUX1 gene, located on 7q22.1, has been characterized genetically as a haplo-insufficient tumor suppressor gene (PMID: 31320321).

In the context of AML, CSF3R mutations are identified in approximately 2-4% of AML cases and 1-2% of MDS cases. Activating mutations of the CSF3R protein lead to constitutive JAK-STAT pathway signalling (Zhang (2017) PMID:28439110). The predictive and prognostic significance of CSF3R mutations in AML remain uncertain. Activating changes in CSF3R are a diagnostic feature of chronic neutrophilic leukemia (CNL) (WHO PMID: 31769070) but may also be identified in a subset of atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (aCML) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) (NCCN Guidelines - MDS 2021; Pardanani (2013) PMID:23604229, Gotlib (2013) PMID:23896413; Maxson (2013) PMID:23656643). Activating CSF3R changes are associated with more aggressive disease in CNL and sensitivity to ruxolitinib (Dao (2020) PMID:31880950, Szuber (2020) PMID:31769070). Emerging data suggests that aCML patients with CSF3R or JAK2 mutations may respond to ruxolitinib therapy in combination with HMAs (hypomethylating agent) (NCCN Guidelines - MDS 2021).

In the context of AML, CHEK2 was identified as the most frequent germline mutated gene in a cohort of 391 adult patients with AML. However, more data is warranted to clarify the role of germline CHEK2 mutations in the development of myeloid malignancies (Freiman et al. 2022)
CBL	chr11	119,206,338	119,308,149	plus	NA	NA	NA	NA	Core	Yes	Yes	Deletion/CN loss	LOF	AML, MDS, MPN, AA	1B for MPN, 2 for AML, 3A for MDS	NA	Optical Genome Mapping detected a [Deletion/CN loss] mutation involving the CBL gene on chr11 with a variant allele frequency (VAF) of [%].	In the context of AML, CBL mutations occur in 1-3% of AML cases, 1-2% of all MPN caes, 5% of MDS cases and 10-15% in MDS/MPN overlap syndromes (e.g. CMML) (NCCN Guidelines - MDS 2023). Preclinical studies have shown leukemic cells expressing mutant CBL and wild-type FLT3 are sensitive to FLT3 inhibition (Weisberg (2019) PMID: 31309543; Weisberg (2020) PMID: 31943762). The predictive and prognostic significance of CBL mutations in MDS remain uncertain. CBL mutations are associated with inferior overall survival in MF patients post allogeneic SCT (NCCN Guidelines - MPN 2022).

In the context of AML, CALR mutations are identified in 20-25% of MF and ET cases though rarely identified in de novo AML cases. PMF patients with a CALR mutation have improved survival compared to either JAK2-mutant or triple-negative patients (NCCN Guidelines - MPN 2023) and ET patients with a CALR mutation have a lower-risk of thrombosis compared to JAK2-mutated ET (NCCN Guidelines - MPN 2023). The predictive and prognostic significance of CALR in AML remain uncertain.

In the context of AML, Biallelic germ line ERCC6L2 variants strongly predispose to bone marrow failure (BMF) and myeloid malignancies, characterized by somatic TP53-mutated clones and erythroid predominance. The prognosis of MDS/AML in patients with ERCC6L2 germline variants is poor, especially when progression to acute erythroid leukemia is noted (PMID: 37091189).

In the context of AML, AD21 mutations are identified in approximately 4-5% of AML cases. The predictive and prognostic significance of RAD21 mutations in AML remain uncertain (Tsai (2017) PMID:29288251; Thol (2014) PMID:24335498). Mutations in cohesin complex genes, including RAD21, are identified in approximately 8-12% of MDS cases (Kon (2013) PMID:23955599; Thota (2014) PMID:25006131). Although one study identified an association between cohesin complex mutations and a decreased overall survival (Thota (2014) PMID:25006131) there is insufficient data on the prognosis and predictive significance of cohesion complex gene mutation in MDS.

In myeloid malignancies, disruption of WT1 promotes stem cell proliferation and leukemic transformation (Pronier (2018) PMID:30064973; Rampal (2016) PMID:27252512). WT1 mutations have been identified in approximately 10% of AML patients. Conflicting data exists regarding the prognostic or predictive significance of WT1 mutations in AML (Rampal (2016) PMID:27252512; Marcucci (2011) PMID:21220609). WT1 mutations are uncommon in MDS patients. In MDS, WT1 mutations are associated with a poor prognosis (NCCN Guidelines - MDS 2023) and with a higher risk of transformation to secondary AML (Makishima (2017) PMID:27992414). WT1 mutations are rarely identified in MPN patients. The predictive and prognostic significance of WT1 mutations in MPNs remain uncertain.
