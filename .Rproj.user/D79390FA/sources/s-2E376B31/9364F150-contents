#### **Overview of variant tiering framework**
The interpretation of clinical significance of acquired genomic variants relies on their impact on clinical care, encompassing diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic relevance. The degree of clinical impact is assessed based on the available evidence regarding its association with a specific diagnosis, disease outcome, or therapeutic outcome. The evidence used for categorizing variants is given varying weight depending on its potential influence on clinical decision-making. For example, greater importance is placed on professional practice guidelines, large collaborative studies, and replicated studies. Variants detected by OGM will be analyzed and interpreted in accordance with a 4-tier evidence-based categorization system adapted from Mikhail et al. 2019 and Li et al. 2017. Analysis involves a gene-based approach to filtering SVs down to relevant findings and assigning tiers. 

#### **Tier Descriptions**
**TIER I** – VARIANTS OF STRONG CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE
Variants are predictive of response or resistance in a specific tumour type to therapies approved by Health Canada or are predictive, prognostic or diagnostic biomarkers in the specific tumour type, based on well-powered studies with consensus from experts in the field and inclusion in professional guidelines (WHO/ICC/ELN).

**TIER IB** – VARIANTS OF STRONG CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE
Variants are strongly associated with specific neoplasms and diagnosis, prognosis or treatment response with high quality evidence (CEBM 1, 2, 3)

**TIER II** – VARIANTS OF POTENTIAL CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE
Variants are typically observed in different neoplasms but not specific to tumour types and are also associated with specific neoplasms, prognosis and treatment response with average quality evidence (CEBM 4, 5) 

**TIER IIIA** –VARIANTS OF UNCERTAIN CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE
Variants are cytogenetically visible variants (> 10Mb) with no documented neoplastic disorder association or evidence for diagnostic and prognostic relevance

**TIER IIIB** – VARIANTS OF UNCERTAIN CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE 
Variants are small variants (< 10 Mb) with no documented neoplastic disorder association or evidence for diagnostic and prognostic relevance.. 

**TIER IV** – BENIGN AND LIKELY BENIGN VARIANTS
Variants are known or presumed to not disrupt normal gene function, and/or are found at a significant allele frequency within the population.  [Tier IV variants are not routinely reported.]
