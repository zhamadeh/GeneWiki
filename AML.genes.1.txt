In the context of AML, CSF3R mutations are identified in approximately 2-4% of AML cases and 1-2% of MDS cases. Activating mutations of the CSF3R protein lead to constitutive JAK-STAT pathway signalling (Zhang (2017) PMID:28439110). The predictive and prognostic significance of CSF3R mutations in AML remain uncertain. Activating changes in CSF3R are a diagnostic feature of chronic neutrophilic leukemia (CNL) (WHO PMID: 31769070) but may also be identified in a subset of atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (aCML) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) (NCCN Guidelines - MDS 2021; Pardanani (2013) PMID:23604229, Gotlib (2013) PMID:23896413; Maxson (2013) PMID:23656643). Activating CSF3R changes are associated with more aggressive disease in CNL and sensitivity to ruxolitinib (Dao (2020) PMID:31880950, Szuber (2020) PMID:31769070). Emerging data suggests that aCML patients with CSF3R or JAK2 mutations may respond to ruxolitinib therapy in combination with HMAs (hypomethylating agent) (NCCN Guidelines - MDS 2021).
