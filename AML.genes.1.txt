In the context of AML, RAD21 mutations are identified in approximately 4-5% of AML cases. The predictive and prognostic significance of RAD21 mutations in AML remain uncertain (Tsai (2017) PMID:29288251; Thol (2014) PMID:24335498). Mutations in cohesin complex genes, including RAD21, are identified in approximately 8-12% of MDS cases (Kon (2013) PMID:23955599; Thota (2014) PMID:25006131). Although one study identified an association between cohesin complex mutations and a decreased overall survival (Thota (2014) PMID:25006131) there is insufficient data on the prognosis and predictive significance of cohesion complex gene mutation in MDS.

Although one study identified an association between DNMT3A mutations and a decreased overall survival in MDS (PMID:21415852), there is insufficient data on the prognosis and predictive significance of DNMT3A mutations in MDS.
