Activating mutations of the CSF3R protein lead to constitutive JAK-STAT pathway signalling (Zhang (2017) PMID:28439110). The predictive and prognostic significance of CSF3R mutations in AML remain uncertain. Activating changes in CSF3R are a diagnostic feature of chronic neutrophilic leukemia (CNL) (WHO PMID: 31769070) but may also be identified in a subset of atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (aCML) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) (NCCN Guidelines - MDS 2021; Pardanani (2013) PMID:23604229, Gotlib (2013) PMID:23896413; Maxson (2013) PMID:23656643). Activating CSF3R changes are associated with more aggressive disease in CNL and sensitivity to ruxolitinib (Dao (2020) PMID:31880950, Szuber (2020) PMID:31769070). Emerging data suggests that aCML patients with CSF3R or JAK2 mutations may respond to ruxolitinib therapy in combination with HMAs (hypomethylating agent) (NCCN Guidelines - MDS 2021).

The predictive and prognostic significance of PTPN11 mutations in MPN remain uncertain.

TET2	chr4	105146875	105279803	+	NA	NA	NA	NA	Core	Yes	Yes	Deletion/CN loss	LOF	AML	2	NA	TET2 mutations have been identified in approximately 10-20% of AML cases. In AML, a recent meta-analysis revealed TET2 mutations to be associated with inferior outcomes (Wang (2019) PMID:31023266). While TET2 mutations have been identified in approximately 20-25% of MDS cases, they have not been found to be a significant prognostic marker. Response to hypomethylating agents does however appear to be better in patients harbouring TET2 mutations (NCCN Guidelines - MDS 2023).
