MPL activating mutations are rarely identified in AML cases. The predictive and prognostic significance of MPL mutations in AML remain uncertain. MPL mutations are identified in <5% of MDS patients and are often identified in combination with SF3B1 in MDS/MPN with ring sideroblasts and thrombocytosis (NCCN Guidelines - MDS 2023). Activating MPL mutations are identified in 5-8% of PMF patients and 1-4% of ET patients and are a major diagnostic criterion for these diseases (NCCN Guidelines - MPN 2023).

Due to the rarity of this translocation the prognosis is unclear.

In the context of AML, the activating V600E BRAF mutation is found in 50% of Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) myeloid neoplasms (PMID: 34996063) and is consdered a molecular marker of hairy cell leukemia (HCL) present in >95% of cases (WHO, PMID: 35732829). BRAF mutations are found in <1% of MDS cases "with clinical implications that are likely similar to those of NRAS mutations" (Lindsley (2013) PMID:22934674)

In the context of AML, SH2B3 mutations are associated with inferior overall survival, for MF-free survival, and in patients with ET (NCCN Guidelines - MPN 2022). Mutations in SH2B3 have been identified in <1% of MDS patients. The predictive and prognostic significance of SH2B3 in MDS remain uncertain. Mutations in SH2B3 are rarely identified in AML patients. The predictive and prognostic significance of SH2B3 in AML remain uncertain.

In the context of AML, IDH2 mutations are identified in 10-20% of AML cases, <5% of MDS cases, and <5% of MPN cases. The IDH2 inhibitor enasidenib has been withdrawn from Health Canada for relapsed/refractory AML as of 30 June 2023 following Phase 3 clinical trials (https://recalls-rappels.canada.ca/en/alert-recall/idhifa-enasidenib-mesylate-market-withdrawal-and-continued-access; NCCN Guidelines - AML 2023). IDH2 mutations have been associated with inferior outcomes. This notwithstanding, there is emerging data demonstrating the effectiveness of enasidenib in IDH2 mutated MDS (NCCN Guidelines - MDS v1.2023). IDH2 mutations in PV and ET are associated with inferior overall survival and in PMF with inferior leukemia-free survival and leukemic transformation (NCCN Guidelines - MPN 2022).

In the context of AML, IDH1 mutations are identified in 6-9% of AML cases, <5% of MDS and MPN cases. For AML, treatment with the IDH1 inhibitor ivosidenib may be of benefit (NCCN Guidelines - AML 2023). For MDS, there is emerging data demonstrating the effectiveness of ivosidenib for MDS (Medeiros (2017) PMID:27721426; NCCN Guidelines - MDS 2022). For MPN cases, IDH1 mutations in PV and ET are associated with inferior overall survival and in PMF with inferior leukemia-free survival and leukemic transformation (NCCN Guidelines - MPN 2022).
