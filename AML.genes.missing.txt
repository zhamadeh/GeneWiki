Mutated ASXL1, BCOR, EZH2, RUNX1, SF3B1, SRSF2, STAG2, U2AF1, and/or ZRSR2 associated with adverse risk category (ELN, PMID: 35797463)
CSF3R	chr1	36466042	36483314	-	NA	NA	NA	NA	Core	Yes	Yes	Duplication/CN gain	GOF	AML, MDS, MPN	3A for AML/MDS, activating mutation could be 2 for some MPNs	NA	CSF3R mutations are identified in approximately 2-4% of AML cases and 1-2% of MDS cases. Activating mutations of the CSF3R protein lead to constitutive JAK-STAT pathway signalling (Zhang (2017) PMID:28439110). The predictive and prognostic significance of CSF3R mutations in AML remain uncertain. Activating changes in CSF3R are a diagnostic feature of chronic neutrophilic leukemia (CNL) (WHO PMID: 31769070) but may also be identified in a subset of atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (aCML) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) (NCCN Guidelines - MDS 2021; Pardanani (2013) PMID:23604229, Gotlib (2013) PMID:23896413; Maxson (2013) PMID:23656643). Activating CSF3R changes are associated with more aggressive disease in CNL and sensitivity to ruxolitinib (Dao (2020) PMID:31880950, Szuber (2020) PMID:31769070). Emerging data suggests that aCML patients with CSF3R or JAK2 mutations may respond to ruxolitinib therapy in combination with HMAs (hypomethylating agent) (NCCN Guidelines - MDS 2021).
IDH1	chr2	208236228	208255071	-	NA	NA	NA	NA	Core	Yes	Yes	Duplication/CN gain	GOF	AML, MDS, MPN	1 or 2 depending on disease context	NA	IDH1 mutations are identified in 6-9% of AML cases, <5% of MDS and MPN cases. For AML, treatment with the IDH1 inhibitor ivosidenib may be of benefit (NCCN Guidelines - AML 2023). For MDS, there is emerging data demonstrating the effectiveness of ivosidenib for MDS (Medeiros (2017) PMID:27721426; NCCN Guidelines - MDS 2022). For MPN cases, IDH1 mutations in PV and ET are associated with inferior overall survival and in PMF with inferior leukemia-free survival and leukemic transformation (NCCN Guidelines - MPN 2022).

The IDH2 inhibitor enasidenib has been withdrawn from Health Canada for relapsed/refractory AML as of 30 June 2023 following Phase 3 clinical trials (https://recalls-rappels.canada.ca/en/alert-recall/idhifa-enasidenib-mesylate-market-withdrawal-and-continued-access; NCCN Guidelines - AML 2023). IDH2 mutations have been associated with inferior outcomes. This notwithstanding, there is emerging data demonstrating the effectiveness of enasidenib in IDH2 mutated MDS (NCCN Guidelines - MDS v1.2023). IDH2 mutations in PV and ET are associated with inferior overall survival and in PMF with inferior leukemia-free survival and leukemic transformation (NCCN Guidelines - MPN 2022).
KIT	chr4	54657956	54740715	+	NA	NA	NA	NA	Core	Yes	Yes	Duplication/CN gain	GOF	AML, MDS, MPN	2 for AML, 3A for MDS and MPN	NA	KIT mutations are identified in ~20% of CBF-AML (DiNardo (2016) PMID:27913501) and are infrequent in MDS and MPN. A meta-analysis of CBF AML showed that a KIT mutation in patients with t(8;21), but not inv(16), was associated with an increased risk of relapse and shorter OS (Chen (2016) PMID: 26771376). Nevertheless, 2017 ELN guidelines indicate that KIT mutation status should not be used to assign a patient to a different genetic risk category (Dohner (2017) PMID: 27895058). The predictive and prognostic significance of KIT mutations in MDS and MPN remains uncertain

The predictive and prognostic significance of MPL mutations in AML remain uncertain. MPL mutations are identified in <5% of MDS patients and are often identified in combination with SF3B1 in MDS/MPN with ring sideroblasts and thrombocytosis (NCCN Guidelines - MDS 2023). Activating MPL mutations are identified in 5-8% of PMF patients and 1-4% of ET patients and are a major diagnostic criterion for these diseases (NCCN Guidelines - MPN 2023).

In adult AML, NRAS mutations have not been found to be a significant prognostic marker, however, they have been associated with an adverse prognosis in pediatric AML (Liu (2018) PMID:30194935). RAS mutations have been identified in 5-10% of MDS patients, with a higher frequency in CMML and JMML patients (~15%). In MDS, RAS mutations are associated with an inferior outcome (NCCN Guidelines - MDS 2023). . NRAS mutations have been identified in 6% of MPN cases. In MF, RAS mutations have been associated with inferior outcomes (Santos (2020) PMID: 31628430).
