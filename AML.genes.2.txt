PTPN11 mutation have been correlated with poorer overall survival, however, PTPN11 status should not be used to determine the effectiveness of hypomethylating agents (NCCN Guidelines - MDS 2022).

In AML, a recent meta-analysis revealed TET2 mutations to be associated with inferior outcomes (Wang (2019) PMID:31023266). While TET2 mutations have been identified in approximately 20-25% of MDS cases, they have not been found to be a significant prognostic marker. Response to hypomethylating agents does however appear to be better in patients harbouring TET2 mutations (NCCN Guidelines - MDS 2023).
