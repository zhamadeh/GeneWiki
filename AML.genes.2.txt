In the context of AML, TERC variants are rarely identified as a somatic change in myeloid malignancies. As a germline change, TERC mutations are the cause autosomal dominant dyskeratosis congenita (Savage (2009) PMID:20301779). A referral to the BCCA Hereditary Cancer Program may be warranted (http://www.screeningbc.ca/Hereditary/).

In the context of AML, TET2 mutations have been identified in approximately 10-20% of AML cases. In AML, a recent meta-analysis revealed TET2 mutations to be associated with inferior outcomes (Wang (2019) PMID:31023266). While TET2 mutations have been identified in approximately 20-25% of MDS cases, they have not been found to be a significant prognostic marker. Response to hypomethylating agents does however appear to be better in patients harbouring TET2 mutations (NCCN Guidelines - MDS 2023).

In the context of AML, U2AF1 variants have been identified in ~4% of AML patients (cBioPortal, TCGA dataset) wherein they are associated with inferior outcomes. The present identification of a U2AF1 mutation also supports a diagnosis of AML-MR (ELN Guidelines - AML 2022, NCCN Guidelines - AML 2023). U2AF1 mutations are observed in 8-12% of MDS cases where have been associated with inferior outcomes (NCCN Guidelines - MDS 2023). U2AF1 mutations are more common in patients with MF compared to those with ET and are generally not found in patients with PV (Delic (2016) PMID:27447873). In MPN, U2AF1 mutations are associated with an inferior outcome (NCCN Guidelines - MPN 2023).
