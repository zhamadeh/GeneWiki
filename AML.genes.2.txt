In the context of AML, U2AF1 variants have been identified in ~4% of AML patients (cBioPortal, TCGA dataset) wherein they are associated with inferior outcomes. The present identification of a U2AF1 mutation also supports a diagnosis of AML-MR (ELN Guidelines - AML 2022, NCCN Guidelines - AML 2023). U2AF1 mutations are observed in 8-12% of MDS cases where have been associated with inferior outcomes (NCCN Guidelines - MDS 2023). U2AF1 mutations are more common in patients with MF compared to those with ET and are generally not found in patients with PV (Delic (2016) PMID:27447873). In MPN, U2AF1 mutations are associated with an inferior outcome (NCCN Guidelines - MPN 2023).

In the context of AML, CSF3R mutations are identified in approximately 2-4% of AML cases and 1-2% of MDS cases. Activating mutations of the CSF3R protein lead to constitutive JAK-STAT pathway signalling (Zhang (2017) PMID:28439110). The predictive and prognostic significance of CSF3R mutations in AML remain uncertain. Activating changes in CSF3R are a diagnostic feature of chronic neutrophilic leukemia (CNL) (WHO PMID: 31769070) but may also be identified in a subset of atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (aCML) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) (NCCN Guidelines - MDS 2021; Pardanani (2013) PMID:23604229, Gotlib (2013) PMID:23896413; Maxson (2013) PMID:23656643). Activating CSF3R changes are associated with more aggressive disease in CNL and sensitivity to ruxolitinib (Dao (2020) PMID:31880950, Szuber (2020) PMID:31769070). Emerging data suggests that aCML patients with CSF3R or JAK2 mutations may respond to ruxolitinib therapy in combination with HMAs (hypomethylating agent) (NCCN Guidelines - MDS 2021).

In the context of AML, IDH2 mutations are identified in 10-20% of AML cases, <5% of MDS cases, and <5% of MPN cases. The IDH2 inhibitor enasidenib has been withdrawn from Health Canada for relapsed/refractory AML as of 30 June 2023 following Phase 3 clinical trials (https://recalls-rappels.canada.ca/en/alert-recall/idhifa-enasidenib-mesylate-market-withdrawal-and-continued-access; NCCN Guidelines - AML 2023).

This notwithstanding, there is emerging data demonstrating the effectiveness of enasidenib in IDH2 mutated MDS (NCCN Guidelines - MDS v1.2023).

In the context of AML, KIT mutations are identified in ~20% of CBF-AML (DiNardo (2016) PMID:27913501) and are infrequent in MDS and MPN. A meta-analysis of CBF AML showed that a KIT mutation in patients with t(8;21), but not inv(16), was associated with an increased risk of relapse and shorter OS (Chen (2016) PMID: 26771376). Nevertheless, 2017 ELN guidelines indicate that KIT mutation status should not be used to assign a patient to a different genetic risk category (Dohner (2017) PMID: 27895058).
